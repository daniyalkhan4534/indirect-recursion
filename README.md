# indirect-recursion

Recursion is a widely used phenomenon in computer science used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler ones. Recursion is a process by which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. The corresponding function is called as recursive function.

Types of Recursions:

Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within itself or more than one function call one another mutually. The first one is called direct recursion and another one is called indirect recursion.


Indirect Recursion: In this recursion, there may be more than one functions and they are calling one another in a circular manner.
